UDACITY: How to Use Git and GitHub

Lesson 3 Reflections 


When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Collaborating, using different computers in different places.. 


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I want neither pull nor push automatically. I can make some experimental changes that I do not want to share with public and I also do not want to share a code which is not complete (or with bugs). In addition, other people can change and make contributions to my remote repositories, I also do not want to pull to my local repository without any evaluation.
